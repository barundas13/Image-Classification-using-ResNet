# Image-Classification-using-ResNet
This repository contains code to train image classification models using ResNet34 and ResNet50 on custom datasets in Google Colab. The code is written in Python and uses various libraries like torch and torchvision.

## Dataset
The images used in this code are taken from the [Surface Crack Detection ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection) dataset. The dataset contains images of various concrete surfaces with and without crack. The image data are divided into two as negative (without crack) and positive (with crack) in separate folder for image classification. Each class has 20000 images with a total of 40000 images with 227 x 227 pixels and RGB channels.
